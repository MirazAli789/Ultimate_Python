# sometimes we don't want to do anything inside a loop that means loop will execute without printing or doing something
# In that case we use the pass keyword
# for example
for i in range(100):
    pass # only execute the for loop without doing anything

j = 0
while(j<=100):
    # print(j)
    # j+=1
    j+=1
    # pass
